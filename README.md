# File-Metadata-Microservice
The File Metadata Microservice project involves building a full-stack JavaScript app that allows users to upload a file through a form. The app should handle the file upload, extract information such as the file name, type, and size in bytes, and respond with this metadata in a JSON format. The project encourages the use of the multer npm package for managing file uploads. The primary objective is to create a functional microservice that successfully processes file metadata and provides a JSON response as specified in the tests.
